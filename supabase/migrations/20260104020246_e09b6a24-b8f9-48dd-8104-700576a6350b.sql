Understanding how dividend tax works is essential for UK company directors who want to maximise their take-home pay while remaining fully compliant with HMRC. The 2025/26 tax year brings important considerations for anyone receiving dividends from their limited company.

**Understanding Dividend Tax Rates in 2025/26**

The UK operates a tiered system for taxing dividends, with rates depending on which income tax band your total income falls into. For the 2025/26 tax year, the dividend tax rates are:

• **Basic Rate (8.75%)** - Applies to dividends falling within the basic rate band (income up to £50,270)
• **Higher Rate (33.75%)** - Applies to dividends falling within the higher rate band (income between £50,271 and £125,140)
• **Additional Rate (39.35%)** - Applies to dividends for income exceeding £125,140

These rates are significantly lower than the equivalent income tax rates for salary (20%, 40%, and 45%), which is why dividends remain a tax-efficient way to extract profits from your company.

**The Dividend Allowance Explained**

Every UK taxpayer receives a tax-free dividend allowance. For 2025/26, this allowance is **£500**. This means the first £500 of dividends you receive each tax year is completely tax-free, regardless of your income level.

**Important:** The dividend allowance has reduced significantly over recent years:
• 2022/23: £2,000
• 2023/24: £1,000
• 2024/25: £500
• 2025/26: £500

This reduction means directors need to be more strategic about their dividend planning than ever before.

**How Dividend Tax is Calculated**

Dividend tax is calculated after your personal allowance and any salary income. Here is how it works:

**STEP_HEADER Step 1: Calculate Your Total Income**

Add together all your income sources: salary, dividends, rental income, interest, and any other taxable income.

**STEP_HEADER Step 2: Apply Your Personal Allowance**

Deduct your personal allowance (£12,570 for 2025/26) from your total income. Note that the personal allowance reduces by £1 for every £2 earned over £100,000.

**STEP_HEADER Step 3: Apply Your Dividend Allowance**

The first £500 of dividends is tax-free.

**STEP_HEADER Step 4: Calculate Tax on Remaining Dividends**

Apply the appropriate rate based on which tax band your remaining dividends fall into.

**Worked Examples for Different Income Levels**

**Example 1: Basic Rate Taxpayer**

Sarah takes a salary of £12,570 (using her full personal allowance) and dividends of £40,000.

• Total income: £52,570
• Personal allowance used by salary: £12,570
• Taxable dividends: £40,000
• Dividend allowance: £500 (tax-free)
• Remaining taxable dividends: £39,500
• Basic rate band remaining: £37,700 (£50,270 - £12,570)
• Dividends at basic rate: £37,700 × 8.75% = £3,298.75
• Dividends at higher rate: £1,800 × 33.75% = £607.50
• **Total dividend tax: £3,906.25**

**Example 2: Higher Rate Taxpayer**

James takes a salary of £12,570 and dividends of £80,000.

• Total income: £92,570
• Taxable dividends after allowance: £79,500
• Basic rate dividends (£37,700): £3,298.75
• Higher rate dividends (£41,800): £14,107.50
• **Total dividend tax: £17,406.25**

**Tax Planning Strategies for Directors**

**1. Optimise Your Salary Level**

Taking a salary up to the National Insurance Primary Threshold (£12,570) uses your personal allowance while avoiding employee National Insurance contributions. Your company can still claim Corporation Tax relief on this amount.

**2. Spread Dividends Across Tax Years**

If you have flexibility, consider timing dividend payments to utilise basic rate bands across multiple tax years rather than pushing into higher rate territory in a single year.

**3. Utilise Spouse or Partner Shareholdings**

If your spouse or civil partner is a shareholder and has unused personal allowance or basic rate band, dividends paid to them will be taxed at their marginal rate. This must reflect genuine shareholding - see our guide on dividend waivers for important compliance considerations.

**4. Consider Pension Contributions**

Making pension contributions through your company reduces Corporation Tax and can be more tax-efficient than taking additional dividends.

**5. Retain Profits in the Company**

If you do not need all the profits personally, leaving them in the company means only paying Corporation Tax (25% for profits over £250,000, or 19-25% for smaller profits) rather than dividend tax on top.

**WARNING_BOX Always ensure you have sufficient retained profits before declaring dividends. Paying dividends from capital rather than profits can result in the dividend being treated as salary for tax purposes, with significant National Insurance implications.**

**Common Questions About Dividend Tax**

**Do I need to file a Self Assessment tax return for dividends?**

Yes, if your dividend income exceeds £10,000 in a tax year, or if you have any higher or additional rate tax to pay, you must file a Self Assessment tax return.

**When do I pay dividend tax?**

Dividend tax is collected through Self Assessment. You will typically pay by 31 January following the end of the tax year, with possible payments on account required in July.

**Can I offset dividend tax with other allowances?**

Your personal allowance is applied to income in a specific order (salary before dividends), but you cannot directly offset dividend tax with other allowances beyond the dividend allowance itself.

**What records do I need to keep?**

You should maintain dividend vouchers for every dividend payment, board minutes authorising dividend declarations, and records of your shareholding structure.

**Key Takeaways**

• Dividend tax rates for 2025/26 are 8.75% (basic), 33.75% (higher), and 39.35% (additional)
• The dividend allowance remains at £500 for 2025/26
• Taking an optimal salary of £12,570 maximises tax efficiency for most directors
• Careful planning can help you stay within lower tax bands
• Always ensure dividends are properly documented with vouchers and board minutes
• Consider the whole picture including Corporation Tax, personal tax, and National Insurance

• Understanding Retained Profits
• The Case for Keeping Profits in Your Company
• When to Pay Dividends
• Tax Implications of Each Approach
• Cash Flow Considerations
• Building a Decision Framework
• Common Scenarios and Recommendations
• Key Takeaways

One of the most important financial decisions UK company directors face is whether to distribute profits as dividends or retain them within the business. This choice affects your tax position, company growth potential, and personal financial planning. Here is how to make the right decision for your circumstances in 2025/26.

**Understanding Retained Profits**

Retained profits (also called retained earnings) are the portion of your company''s net income that remains in the business after paying Corporation Tax and any dividends. These profits accumulate on your company''s balance sheet and can be used for:

• Reinvestment in the business
• Building cash reserves
• Funding future expansion
• Providing working capital
• Acquiring assets or other businesses

**The Case for Keeping Profits in Your Company**

**1. Lower Immediate Tax Burden**

When profits remain in your company, you only pay Corporation Tax on them. For the 2025/26 tax year:

• **Small profits rate (19%)** - For companies with profits up to £50,000
• **Main rate (25%)** - For companies with profits over £250,000
• **Marginal relief** - For profits between £50,000 and £250,000

Compare this to taking dividends where you pay Corporation Tax first, then dividend tax on top (8.75% to 39.35% depending on your personal tax band). The combined effective tax rate on dividends can exceed 50% for higher earners.

**2. Building Business Value**

Retained profits increase your company''s net assets, which can:
• Improve your ability to secure financing
• Increase the company''s value for potential sale
• Provide security for future uncertainties
• Fund growth without external borrowing

**3. Protection Against Uncertainty**

Having cash reserves protects your business against:
• Economic downturns
• Late-paying customers
• Unexpected expenses
• Seasonal fluctuations

**WARNING_BOX HMRC may scrutinize companies with very large accumulated reserves and no clear business purpose for retaining them. Ensure you can demonstrate a genuine commercial reason for holding significant profits within the company.**

**When to Pay Dividends**

**1. Personal Income Needs**

The most straightforward reason to declare dividends is when you need personal income to cover living expenses, mortgage payments, or other financial commitments.

**2. Tax-Efficient Extraction**

For basic rate taxpayers, dividends remain one of the most tax-efficient ways to extract profits. If you have unused basic rate band, taking dividends up to that threshold makes sense.

**3. Utilising Allowances**

Each shareholder has their own:
• Personal allowance (£12,570)
• Dividend allowance (£500)
• Basic rate band

If family members are shareholders, dividends can utilise their individual allowances.

**4. Company Surplus**

If your company has more cash than it needs for operations and you have no immediate reinvestment plans, extracting some profits can be sensible rather than leaving money idle.

**Tax Implications of Each Approach**

**Scenario: £50,000 Profit Available**

**Option A: Retain All Profits**
• Corporation Tax (assume small profits rate): £50,000 × 19% = £9,500
• Tax paid: **£9,500**
• Retained in company: £40,500

**Option B: Pay as Dividends (Basic Rate Taxpayer)**
• Corporation Tax: £9,500
• Distributable profits: £40,500
• Less dividend allowance: £500
• Taxable dividends: £40,000
• Dividend tax at 8.75%: £3,500
• Total tax paid: **£13,000**
• Net to shareholder: £37,000

**Option C: Pay as Dividends (Higher Rate Taxpayer)**
• Corporation Tax: £9,500
• Distributable profits: £40,500
• Less dividend allowance: £500
• Taxable dividends: £40,000
• Dividend tax at 33.75%: £13,500
• Total tax paid: **£23,000**
• Net to shareholder: £27,000

**Cash Flow Considerations**

**STEP_HEADER Step 1: Assess Your Business Cash Requirements**

Before deciding on dividends, calculate:
• Monthly operating expenses (3-6 months'' worth as a minimum reserve)
• Upcoming capital expenditure
• Seasonal cash flow variations
• Outstanding debts or tax liabilities

**STEP_HEADER Step 2: Evaluate Personal Financial Needs**

Consider:
• Regular living expenses
• Mortgage or rent payments
• Savings goals
• Pension contributions (which may be better made through the company)

**STEP_HEADER Step 3: Plan for Tax Payments**

Remember:
• Corporation Tax is typically due 9 months and 1 day after your accounting period ends
• Dividend tax is paid through Self Assessment
• Large companies may need to pay Corporation Tax in instalments

**Building a Decision Framework**

Ask yourself these questions:

**1. Do I have sufficient personal income from other sources?**
If yes → Consider retaining more profits
If no → Take dividends to meet personal needs

**2. Am I a basic rate or higher rate taxpayer?**
Basic rate → Dividends are relatively tax-efficient
Higher rate → Consider alternatives like pension contributions

**3. Does my company need funds for growth or investment?**
If yes → Retain profits for business purposes
If no → Excess cash could be distributed

**4. What are my long-term business plans?**
Planning to sell → Building retained earnings increases company value
Planning to wind up → Extract profits over time tax-efficiently

**5. Do I have other shareholders?**
If yes → Consider their tax positions and preferences
If no → Focus solely on your optimal strategy

**Common Scenarios and Recommendations**

**Scenario 1: New Business Building Reserves**
*Recommendation:* Prioritise retaining profits to build a cash buffer. Take only what you need personally, ideally staying within basic rate bands.

**Scenario 2: Established Business with Surplus Cash**
*Recommendation:* Consider a balanced approach. Retain sufficient working capital plus growth funds, distribute the rest through tax-efficient means.

**Scenario 3: Preparing for Retirement**
*Recommendation:* Maximise pension contributions through the company (Corporation Tax deductible). Plan a gradual extraction strategy over several tax years.

**Scenario 4: Multiple Family Shareholders**
*Recommendation:* Utilise each shareholder''s allowances and basic rate bands. Consider alphabet shares for flexible dividend allocation.

**Scenario 5: Planning to Sell the Business**
*Recommendation:* Retain profits to maximise company value. When you sell, Business Asset Disposal Relief (10% CGT) may apply up to a £1 million lifetime limit.

**Key Takeaways**

• Retained profits are only subject to Corporation Tax (19-25%), making them cheaper than dividends in the short term
• Dividends incur additional personal tax of 8.75% to 39.35% on top of Corporation Tax
• Always maintain adequate working capital before declaring dividends
• Consider the whole picture: business needs, personal needs, tax efficiency, and future plans
• Family shareholding structures can help utilise multiple allowances
• Pension contributions through your company may be more tax-efficient than dividends
• Document your dividend decisions properly with board minutes and vouchers

**Streamline Your Dividend Process**

Whether you are taking regular dividends or occasional distributions, proper documentation is essential. Dividify helps you create compliant dividend vouchers and board minutes in seconds, ensuring your profit extraction is always properly recorded.',

• Understanding Overdrawn and Credit Balances
• Section 455 Tax Explained
• Benefit in Kind Implications
• The 9-Month Rule
• Common Pitfalls to Avoid
• Best Practices for Managing Your DLA
• Key Takeaways

Director''s loan accounts are one of the most misunderstood aspects of running a limited company. Get it wrong, and you could face unexpected tax bills, benefit in kind charges, and HMRC scrutiny. This guide explains everything UK directors need to know about DLAs in 2025.

**What is a Director''s Loan Account?**

A director''s loan account (DLA) is a record of all transactions between a director and their company that are not salary, dividends, or expense reimbursements. It tracks money flowing in both directions:

**Money you put INTO the company:**
• Personal funds used to start the business
• Loans to help with cash flow
• Payments for company expenses from personal funds

**Money you take OUT of the company:**
• Cash withdrawals
• Personal expenses paid by the company
• Use of company assets

The DLA balance can be in credit (the company owes you money) or overdrawn (you owe the company money). The tax implications differ dramatically between these two states.

**Understanding Overdrawn and Credit Balances**

**Credit Balance (Company Owes You)**

When your DLA is in credit, the company owes you money. This can happen when:
• You''ve loaned the company money
• You''ve paid company expenses personally
• The company hasn''t fully reimbursed you

**Tax implications:** Generally none. You can withdraw this money at any time without tax consequences. The company may choose to pay you interest on the loan, which would be taxable income for you but an allowable expense for the company.

**Overdrawn Balance (You Owe the Company)**

When your DLA is overdrawn, you owe the company money. This creates potential tax issues:
• Section 455 tax for the company
• Possible benefit in kind for you
• Potential dividend treatment

**WARNING_BOX An overdrawn director''s loan account is one of the most common triggers for HMRC enquiries into small companies. Maintaining proper records and understanding the rules is essential.**

**Section 455 Tax Explained**

Section 455 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 requires companies to pay a special tax charge when directors have overdrawn loan accounts that are not repaid within 9 months after the company''s accounting year end.

**How it works:**

**STEP_HEADER Step 1: Year End Assessment**

At your company''s year end, if your DLA is overdrawn, the company notes this on its Corporation Tax return.

**STEP_HEADER Step 2: The 9-Month Deadline**

You have 9 months after your accounting year end to clear the balance. If your year end is 31 March 2025, the deadline is 31 December 2025.

**STEP_HEADER Step 3: S455 Tax Payment**

If the loan isn''t repaid by the deadline, the company must pay S455 tax at **33.75%** of the outstanding loan amount. This is paid along with the Corporation Tax.

**STEP_HEADER Step 4: Claiming the Tax Back**

S455 tax is refundable once the loan is repaid, but there''s a significant delay. You can only reclaim it 9 months after the end of the accounting period in which the loan was repaid.

**Example:**
• Year end: 31 March 2025
• Overdrawn DLA at year end: £10,000
• S455 tax due (if not repaid by 31 Dec 2025): £3,375
• Loan repaid: 15 January 2026
• Tax refund available: 1 January 2027

**Benefit in Kind Implications**

If your overdrawn loan exceeds £10,000 at any point during the tax year and the company doesn''t charge you interest (or charges below the official rate), you''ll face benefit in kind (BIK) consequences.

**The Official Rate**

For 2025/26, the official rate of interest is **2.25%**. If you pay at least this rate, no BIK arises.

**BIK Calculation**

The benefit is the difference between interest at the official rate and any interest you actually pay.

**Example:**
• Average overdrawn balance during year: £50,000
• Official rate: 2.25%
• Interest at official rate: £1,125
• Interest you paid: £0
• Taxable benefit: £1,125

**Tax on the benefit:**
• For you: Income tax on £1,125 at your marginal rate
• For the company: Class 1A NIC at 13.8% = £155.25

The company must report this on a P11D form.

**The 9-Month Rule**

The 9-month rule is crucial for avoiding S455 tax:

• **Corporation Tax payment deadline:** 9 months and 1 day after year end
• **S455 applies if:** Loan is still outstanding at this point
• **Repayment window:** You have until the CT payment deadline to clear the loan

**Clearing an Overdrawn DLA**

You can clear an overdrawn DLA by:
1. **Repaying the money** - Transfer personal funds to the company
2. **Declaring a dividend** - Use dividends to offset the loan (dividend tax applies)
3. **Voting a salary/bonus** - Income tax and NIC apply
4. **Writing off the loan** - Treated as salary, full PAYE/NIC applies

**WARNING_BOX The "Bed and Breakfasting" rule: If you repay a loan and borrow again within 30 days, HMRC treats the arrangement as if the loan was never repaid. This prevents artificial repayment to avoid S455 tax.**

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid**

**1. Not Keeping Accurate Records**

Every transaction through the DLA should be documented with dates, amounts, and descriptions. Many directors don''t realise their account is overdrawn until it''s too late.

**2. Using the Company as a Personal Bank Account**

Treating company funds as your own leads to a constantly overdrawn DLA and ongoing tax complications.

**3. Ignoring the £10,000 BIK Threshold**

Even short periods where your loan exceeds £10,000 can trigger benefit in kind reporting requirements.

**4. Missing the 9-Month Deadline**

Diary the date 9 months after your year end. Repaying even one day late means paying S455 tax.

**5. Bed and Breakfasting**

Repaying loans temporarily to avoid tax, then borrowing again quickly, is caught by anti-avoidance rules.

**6. Mixing Personal and Business Expenses**

Always keep personal and business spending separate. Use a dedicated business card and account.

**Best Practices for Managing Your DLA**

**1. Review Monthly**

Check your DLA balance at least monthly, not just at year end.

**2. Set Up Proper Expense Claims**

Create a formal expense claim process rather than paying personally and "sorting it out later."

**3. Take Regular Dividends**

If you need income, declare and document proper dividends rather than withdrawing cash against your DLA.

**4. Consider Interest-Bearing Loans**

If you lend money to the company, consider charging interest. The company gets a tax deduction, and you declare the interest as income.

**5. Plan Ahead for Year End**

Well before your year end, review the DLA position and plan how to clear any overdrawn balance.

**6. Keep Company Funds Separate**

Resist the temptation to use company money for personal expenses. It creates complications and risks.

**7. Document Everything**

Every transaction should have supporting documentation. If HMRC enquires, good records are your best defence.

**Record-Keeping Requirements**

For each DLA transaction, record:
• Date of transaction
• Amount
• Description (what the money was for)
• Whether it''s a debit (you taking) or credit (you putting in)
• Running balance

**Key Takeaways**

• A director''s loan account tracks non-salary, non-dividend transactions between you and your company
• Overdrawn DLAs (you owe the company) create tax complications
• S455 tax (33.75%) applies if loans aren''t repaid within 9 months of year end
• Loans over £10,000 without interest create benefit in kind charges
• The "bed and breakfasting" rule prevents artificial repayment schemes
• Good record-keeping is essential - review your DLA monthly
• Always take formal dividends or salary rather than just withdrawing cash
• Plan ahead to ensure your DLA is clear before the 9-month deadline

**Stay Compliant with Proper Documentation**

Managing your DLA effectively starts with proper documentation of all company transactions. Dividify helps you create compliant dividend vouchers and board minutes, ensuring your profit extraction is always properly recorded and doesn''t inadvertently flow through your director''s loan account.',

• The Optimal Salary for 2025/26
• Dividend Tax Rates Explained
• Worked Examples: Finding Your Optimal Mix
• National Insurance Considerations
• Corporation Tax and Salary Deductions
• When Higher Salaries Make Sense
• Common Mistakes to Avoid
• Key Takeaways

Finding the right balance between salary and dividends is one of the most important tax planning decisions for UK company directors. Get it right, and you could save thousands in tax. This guide shows you exactly how to optimise your remuneration strategy for the 2025/26 tax year.

**Understanding the Tax Difference**

Salary and dividends are taxed very differently in the UK:

**Salary:**
• Subject to Income Tax (20%, 40%, 45%)
• Subject to Employee National Insurance (8% between £12,570 and £50,270)
• Subject to Employer National Insurance (13.8% above £9,100)
• Corporation Tax deductible for the company

**Dividends:**
• Subject to Income Tax at special rates (8.75%, 33.75%, 39.35%)
• NO National Insurance at all
• Paid from post-Corporation Tax profits
• £500 tax-free dividend allowance

The key difference is National Insurance. While salary attracts up to 21.8% in combined employee and employer NI, dividends have no NI at all.

**The Optimal Salary for 2025/26**

For most directors, the optimal salary is at or around the **National Insurance Primary Threshold of £12,570**.

**Why this amount?**

• It equals the Personal Allowance, so no Income Tax is due
• Below the Employee NI threshold, so no employee NI is due
• Your company can still claim Corporation Tax relief on the salary
• You get a qualifying year for State Pension purposes

**The Numbers:**

Salary of £12,570:
• Income Tax: £0 (covered by Personal Allowance)
• Employee NI: £0 (below threshold)
• Employer NI: £479 (13.8% on £12,570 - £9,100 = £3,470)
• Corporation Tax saving: £3,262 (at 25% on £12,570 + £479)

**Net cost to company:** £9,787
**You receive:** £12,570

**Dividend Tax Rates Explained**

After taking your optimal salary, remaining profits can be extracted as dividends at preferential rates:

• **Basic Rate Band** (income up to £50,270): **8.75%**
• **Higher Rate Band** (£50,271 to £125,140): **33.75%**
• **Additional Rate Band** (over £125,140): **39.35%**

Plus, you get a **£500 dividend allowance** - the first £500 of dividends each year is tax-free.

**Worked Examples: Finding Your Optimal Mix**

**Example 1: Extracting £50,000 Total**

**Option A: All Salary**
• Gross salary: £50,000
• Employee NI: £2,998
• Income Tax: £7,486
• Employer NI: £5,644
• Take-home: £39,516
• Corporation Tax saved: £13,911

**Total tax cost: £16,128**
**Net to you: £39,516**
**Net cost to company: £55,644**

**Option B: Optimal Salary + Dividends**
• Salary: £12,570 (no Income Tax, no employee NI)
• Employer NI: £479
• Net salary: £12,570
• Corporation Tax on remaining profit (£37,430 - £479 after employer NI): £9,238
• Distributable dividends: £28,192
• Dividend tax: £2,423 (after £500 allowance)
• Net dividends: £25,769

**Total tax cost: £12,140**
**Net to you: £38,339**
**Net cost to company: £50,479**

**Saving with Option B: £3,988 less tax**

**Example 2: Extracting £100,000 Total**

**Option A: All Salary**
• Employee NI: £2,998
• Income Tax: £27,432
• Employer NI: £12,544
• Take-home: £69,570

**Total tax cost: £42,974**

**Option B: Optimal Salary + Dividends**
• Salary: £12,570
• Employer NI: £479
• Net salary: £12,570
• Corporation Tax on £87,430: £21,858
• Distributable dividends: £65,572
• Dividend allowance: £500
• Basic rate dividends (£37,200): £3,255
• Higher rate dividends (£27,872): £9,407
• Total dividend tax: £12,662
• Net dividends: £52,910

**Total tax cost: £34,999**
**Net to you: £65,480**

**Saving with Option B: £7,975 less tax**

**National Insurance Considerations**

**Employee National Insurance (2025/26)**
• 0% on earnings up to £12,570
• 8% on earnings between £12,570 and £50,270
• 2% on earnings above £50,270

**Employer National Insurance (2025/26)**
• 0% on earnings up to £9,100
• 13.8% on earnings above £9,100

**The Employment Allowance**

If your company has other employees, you may be able to claim the **Employment Allowance** of £5,000, which reduces your employer NI bill. This could affect your optimal salary calculation.

**State Pension Qualification**

To get a qualifying year for State Pension, you need to earn at least the Lower Earnings Limit (£6,396 for 2025/26). A salary of £12,570 easily meets this threshold.

**Corporation Tax and Salary Deductions**

Salary is a tax-deductible expense for your company, reducing your Corporation Tax bill. Dividends are not deductible - they''re paid from post-tax profits.

**Example:**
• Company profit before salary: £100,000
• Salary paid: £12,570 (plus £479 employer NI)
• Taxable profit: £86,951
• Corporation Tax (25%): £21,738

If no salary was taken:
• Taxable profit: £100,000
• Corporation Tax (25%): £25,000

**Corporation Tax saved by taking salary: £3,262**

**When Higher Salaries Make Sense**

While the £12,570 salary is optimal for most, there are exceptions:

**1. Mortgage Applications**

Lenders often prefer salary income over dividends. A higher salary might help you qualify for a larger mortgage.

**2. Maternity/Paternity Pay**

Statutory maternity pay is based on salary, not dividends. If planning a family, consider the implications.

**3. Employment Allowance Available**

If your company can claim the £5,000 Employment Allowance, higher salaries become more attractive as the employer NI is offset.

**4. Pension Contribution Limits**

Your annual allowance for pension contributions is linked to relevant UK earnings (primarily salary). Very low salary could limit how much you can contribute.

**5. Research and Development Tax Credits**

Staff costs, including director salaries, can form part of R&D claims. Higher salaries increase the claim value.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

**1. Taking No Salary at All**

While it might seem tax-efficient, zero salary means:
• No qualifying year for State Pension
• Difficulties with mortgage applications
• Potential HMRC questions about "disguised remuneration"

**2. Not Considering the Whole Picture**

Your optimal mix depends on your total income from all sources, not just your company.

**3. Forgetting Employer NI**

When calculating the cost of salary, always include the 13.8% employer NI.

**4. Ignoring the Dividend Allowance**

The £500 allowance is tax-free - make sure you use it.

**5. Not Planning Ahead**

Tax years run April to April. Plan your remuneration strategy before the year starts, not after.

**6. Failing to Document Dividends**

Every dividend needs proper documentation: board minutes authorising the payment and dividend vouchers for each shareholder. Without these, HMRC could challenge the dividend treatment.

**WARNING_BOX Always ensure your company has sufficient retained profits before declaring dividends. Dividends paid from capital (rather than profits) can be recharacterised as salary by HMRC, with significant tax consequences.**

**A Simple Decision Framework**

**STEP_HEADER Step 1: Take a Salary of £12,570**

This uses your Personal Allowance and counts toward State Pension without incurring employee NI.

**STEP_HEADER Step 2: Calculate Your Remaining Income Need**

How much more do you need after your £12,570 salary?

**STEP_HEADER Step 3: Check Available Profits**

Ensure your company has sufficient retained profits to cover the dividends.

**STEP_HEADER Step 4: Declare Dividends to Fill Basic Rate Band**

Take dividends up to £37,700 more (total income of £50,270) at only 8.75% tax.

**STEP_HEADER Step 5: Consider Alternatives for Higher Amounts**

If you need more, consider:
• Pension contributions (Corporation Tax deductible, no personal tax)
• Spreading income across tax years
• Spouse dividends (if they''re shareholders)

**Key Takeaways**

• The optimal salary for most directors in 2025/26 is £12,570
• This amount uses your Personal Allowance and qualifies for State Pension
• Dividends above salary are taxed at 8.75% (basic rate) vs up to 21.8% NI on salary
• The £500 dividend allowance makes the first £500 of dividends tax-free
• Corporation Tax relief on salary partially offsets the NI cost
• Document all dividends with proper board minutes and vouchers
• Consider the whole picture: mortgages, pensions, other income sources

**Streamline Your Dividend Process**

Getting the salary vs dividends mix right is just the first step. Documenting those dividends properly is equally important. Dividify helps you create compliant dividend vouchers and board minutes in seconds, ensuring your tax-efficient extraction strategy is fully supported by proper records.',

Dividend waivers can be a useful tool for managing profit distributions in family companies, but they must be used carefully. HMRC closely scrutinises these arrangements, and getting it wrong can result in significant tax bills. This guide explains when waivers are appropriate and how to implement them correctly.

**What is a Dividend Waiver?**

A dividend waiver is a formal document whereby a shareholder gives up their right to receive a dividend that would otherwise be payable to them. When a dividend is declared, the waiving shareholder receives nothing (or a reduced amount), while other shareholders receive their full entitlement.

**Example:**
A husband and wife each own 50% of a company. The company declares a dividend of £10,000 per share (£20,000 total). The husband waives his dividend entirely. The wife receives the full £10,000 she''s entitled to, while the husband receives nothing.

**Important distinction:** A dividend waiver is different from:
• **Not declaring a dividend** - Where no dividend is paid to anyone
• **Alphabet shares** - Different share classes that can receive different dividends
• **Gift of shares** - Transferring ownership of shares

**When Might You Use a Dividend Waiver?**

**1. Tax Planning Between Spouses**

If one spouse is a higher rate taxpayer and the other is a basic rate taxpayer, a waiver could shift dividend income to the lower-taxed spouse.

**WARNING_BOX This is the most common - and most heavily scrutinised - use of dividend waivers. HMRC frequently challenges these arrangements under the "settlements legislation" (ITTOIA 2005 s624-627).**

**2. Preserving Working Capital**

If a shareholder doesn''t need income and wants to leave their share in the company for reinvestment, they might waive their dividend.

**3. Proportional Distributions**

Sometimes shareholders agree that dividends should be distributed differently from shareholding percentages for genuine commercial reasons.

**4. Managing Cash Flow**

A shareholder might waive a dividend if they know the company cannot afford to pay the full amount to all shareholders.

**Legal Requirements for Valid Waivers**

For a dividend waiver to be legally effective, it must meet specific requirements:

**STEP_HEADER Requirement 1: Made Before the Dividend is Declared**

The waiver must be signed before the dividend declaration. A waiver signed after the dividend is declared is ineffective - you cannot give away income you''ve already become entitled to.

**STEP_HEADER Requirement 2: In Writing**

The waiver should be documented in a formal deed. While a simple letter might suffice, a properly executed deed provides stronger evidence.

**STEP_HEADER Requirement 3: Properly Executed**

As a deed, the waiver should:
• Clearly identify the shareholder waiving
• Specify which dividends are being waived (or state it applies to all dividends until revoked)
• Be signed by the shareholder
• Be witnessed
• Clearly state it is executed as a deed

**STEP_HEADER Requirement 4: Cover a Specific Period**

Waivers can be:
• **Specific** - Covering one particular dividend
• **General** - Covering all dividends until the waiver is revoked

General waivers should include a mechanism for revocation.

**HMRC Scrutiny and Settlements**

HMRC has historically challenged dividend waiver arrangements, particularly between spouses, under the **settlements legislation**.

**The Settlements Legislation (ITTOIA 2005 s624-627)**

This anti-avoidance legislation taxes the "settlor" (the person making the arrangement) on income arising from a "settlement" (an arrangement that shifts income to someone else).

**The Key Case: Arctic Systems (Jones v Garnett)**

In this landmark 2007 case, a husband transferred shares to his wife, who then received dividends. HMRC argued this was a settlement.

**The House of Lords ruled:**
• The initial gift of shares was a settlement
• BUT the "outright gift" exemption applied because the husband had no way to get the shares back
• HMRC lost the case

**However**, this protection may not extend to dividend waivers because:
• The shares aren''t being given away
• The waiver is a new arrangement each time
• The waiver could be revoked

**When HMRC Will Challenge Waivers**

HMRC typically challenges when:
• There is an obvious tax motive
• The waiver benefits a spouse or family member
• There is no clear commercial rationale
• The arrangement is repeated year after year
• The waiving shareholder has contributed work or capital to the company

**Valid Commercial Reasons**

To defend a dividend waiver, you need genuine commercial justification. Examples include:

**1. Retirement Planning**

An older shareholder waives dividends to allow younger shareholders to build capital for the business''s future.

**2. Different Financial Needs**

One shareholder has other income sources and genuinely doesn''t need the dividend, while another relies on it.

**3. Reinvestment Agreement**

Shareholders agree that one party will waive dividends for a period while their share is reinvested in the business.

**4. Cash Flow Management**

The company cannot afford to pay all shareholders, and some voluntarily waive to ensure the business survives.

**5. Non-Contributing Shareholders**

A shareholder who is no longer active in the business waives dividends in favour of those doing the work.

**WARNING_BOX "My spouse is in a lower tax bracket" is NOT a valid commercial reason. The tax saving itself cannot be the primary motivation.**

**Step-by-Step Implementation Guide**

**STEP_HEADER Step 1: Establish Commercial Justification**

Document why the waiver makes commercial sense beyond tax savings. Write this down before proceeding.

**STEP_HEADER Step 2: Take Professional Advice**

Given HMRC scrutiny, consult an accountant or tax advisor before implementing a waiver.

**STEP_HEADER Step 3: Prepare the Deed of Waiver**

Create a formal deed that includes:
• Full name of the waiving shareholder
• The company name and registration number
• The specific dividend(s) being waived OR a statement that all dividends are waived until further notice
• The commercial reason for the waiver
• The date
• Signature of the shareholder
• Witness signature and details

**STEP_HEADER Step 4: Execute Before Dividend Declaration**

The waiver must be signed and dated before the board meeting that declares the dividend.

**STEP_HEADER Step 5: Hold Board Meeting**

Conduct a board meeting to:
• Note the waiver has been received
• Declare the dividend
• Record that the waiving shareholder will not receive payment

**STEP_HEADER Step 6: Issue Dividend Vouchers**

Issue vouchers to shareholders who are receiving dividends. The waiving shareholder does not receive a voucher.

**STEP_HEADER Step 7: Retain Records**

Keep the original deed of waiver, board minutes, and all dividend vouchers with your company records.

**Common Pitfalls and Risks**

**1. Signing After the Dividend is Declared**

The waiver is ineffective. The shareholder is treated as having received the dividend and then gifting it.

**2. No Commercial Justification**

Without genuine business reasons, HMRC may successfully challenge under settlements legislation.

**3. Inconsistent Treatment**

Waiving dividends sometimes but not others, with no clear pattern or reason, raises red flags.

**4. Informal Arrangements**

Verbal agreements or casual emails are not sufficient. Use a properly executed deed.

**5. Ignoring the "Bounteous" Test**

If a shareholder waives so another can receive "bounty" (benefit beyond what they would normally get), it looks like a settlement.

**6. Not Considering Alternatives**

Sometimes alphabet shares or other structures are more appropriate than waivers.

**Alternatives to Dividend Waivers**

**1. Alphabet Shares**

Create different classes of shares (A, B, C, etc.) with the right to pay different dividends to each class. This is often cleaner than waivers.

**2. Different Shareholdings**

If one shareholder should receive more, consider transferring shares (with gift/CGT implications considered).

**3. Salary Payments**

For working shareholders, increased salary might achieve similar outcomes without waiver complications.

**4. Directors'' Loans**

If a shareholder doesn''t need income, leaving dividends as a credit on their director''s loan account (rather than waiving) preserves their entitlement.

**5. No Dividend at All**

If the company doesn''t need to pay dividends, simply don''t declare them.

**Documenting Dividend Waivers: Template**

A dividend waiver deed should include:

**[Deed Header]**
DEED OF WAIVER OF DIVIDEND

**[Parties]**
• Shareholder name and address
• Company name and registration number

**[Recitals]**
• The shareholder holds [X] shares in the company
• The shareholder wishes to waive their entitlement to dividends
• The commercial reason for the waiver

**[Operative Provisions]**
• The shareholder waives all right to dividends declared between [dates] OR until this waiver is revoked in writing
• This waiver is irrevocable for the stated period

**[Execution]**
• Signed as a deed by the shareholder
• Witnessed with witness name, address, and occupation

**Key Takeaways**

• A dividend waiver is a deed where a shareholder gives up their right to receive declared dividends
• Waivers must be signed before the dividend is declared to be effective
• HMRC closely scrutinises waivers between spouses and family members
• You need genuine commercial reasons - tax saving alone is not sufficient
• The Arctic Systems case established important principles but doesn''t protect all waiver arrangements
• Document everything: the commercial rationale, the deed itself, and all board minutes
• Consider alternatives like alphabet shares, which may be more appropriate
• Always take professional advice before implementing a dividend waiver
